# Approach: Private Trade Settlement

**Use Case Links:**

- [Private Bonds](../use-cases/private-bonds.md)
- [Private RWA Tokenization](../use-cases/private-rwa-tokenization.md)
- [Private Derivatives](../use-cases/private-derivatives.md)

**High-level goal:** Enable confidential settlement of complex trades across multiple assets, networks, and jurisdictions while maintaining atomicity, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency.

## Overview

### Problem Interaction

Modern institutional trading requires coordinating multiple complex challenges:

1. **Cross-Border Coordination**: Assets and cash may need to settle on different networks optimized for different purposes (liquidity vs privacy)
2. **Multi-Asset Complexity**: Trades often involve multiple instruments (bonds + cash, derivatives + collateral, etc.) requiring coordinated settlement
3. **Privacy vs Transparency**: Trading strategies must remain confidential while maintaining regulatory oversight and settlement assurance
4. **Settlement Risk**: Ensuring atomic execution across multiple networks, asset types, and time zones

These problems interact because traditional settlement systems assume transparency and single-jurisdiction operations, while institutional privacy needs require coordination across fragmented privacy and liquidity domains.

### Key Constraints

- Must coordinate settlement across multiple networks (where cash has liquidity vs where assets can be private)
- Support for complex settlement patterns (DvP, PvP, multi-leg trades, collateral management)
- Cross-border regulatory compliance with varying privacy requirements
- Integration with existing institutional settlement infrastructure (custodians, CSDs, etc.)
- Real-time settlement coordination with acceptable failure recovery

### TLDR for Different Personas

- **Business:** Execute trades privately across multiple networks while maintaining operational efficiency and regulatory compliance
- **Technical:** Coordinate atomic settlement across privacy domains using conditional settlement protocols and trusted coordination
- **Legal:** Provide regulatory oversight across jurisdictions while protecting proprietary trading information through selective disclosure

## Architecture and Design Choices

### Recommended Architecture: Multi-Network Settlement Coordination

**Primary Pattern:** [ERC-7573 DvP](../patterns/pattern-dvp-erc7573.md) with privacy-preserving coordination
**Supporting Patterns:**

- [Private Payments](../approaches/approach-private-payments.md) for cash leg execution
- [Selective Disclosure](../patterns/pattern-regulatory-disclosure-keys-proofs.md)
- [Private L2s](../patterns/pattern-privacy-l2s.md) for asset leg privacy
- [MPC Custody](../patterns/pattern-mpc-custody.md) for institutional coordination

#### Core Components:

1. **Settlement Coordination Layer**

   - Cross-network settlement orchestration using ERC-7573 with conditional atomicity
   - Trusted or MPC-based relayers for privacy-preserving coordination
   - Settlement state management across multiple domains
   - Failure handling and rollback mechanisms

2. **Multi-Domain Execution**

   - Cash Domain: Settlement on networks with deep stablecoin liquidity (Ethereum L1)
   - Asset Domain: Private execution on networks optimized for confidentiality (Privacy L2s, shielded pools)
   - Bridge Coordination: Secure communication between domains without information leakage

3. **Institutional Integration**

   - Custody Integration: Coordination with existing custodial infrastructure
   - Settlement Timing: Support settlement cycles as required
   - Risk Management: Real-time exposure monitoring and margin management
   - Regulatory Reporting: Automated compliance reporting across jurisdictions

4. **Privacy-Preserving Coordination**

   - Trusted Relayers: Institutional-grade settlement coordination services
   - MPC Coordination: Decentralized multi-party settlement coordination
   - Hidden State: Settlement coordination without revealing trade details
   - Selective Disclosure: Regulatory oversight through controlled access mechanisms

### Vendor Recommendations

**Primary Infrastructure:**

- Settlement Coordination: Native ERC-7573 implementations with privacy-preserving relayers
- Cash Domain: [Private Payments](../approaches/approach-private-payments.md) infrastructure (Railgun, Aztec)
- Asset Domain: [Privacy L2s](../patterns/pattern-privacy-l2s.md), [Shielded Pools](../patterns/pattern-shielding.md), [Privacy Pools](../vendors/privacypools.md)
- Institutional Services: [MPC Custody](../patterns/pattern-mpc-custody.md) providers, institutional relayer networks

**Supporting Infrastructure:**

- Compliance: [ERC-3643 ONCHAINID](../patterns/pattern-erc3643-rwa.md), [Chainlink ACE](../vendors/chainlink-ace.md) for regulatory compliance automation

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Single-Network Private Settlement**

- Deploy privacy-preserving DvP on chosen privacy infrastructure
- Implement basic settlement coordination with single asset/cash pairs
- Establish selective disclosure mechanisms for regulatory compliance

**Phase 2: Cross-Network Coordination**

- Implement ERC-7573 conditional settlement across networks
- Deploy trusted or MPC relayer infrastructure
- Integrate with existing custodial and settlement systems

**Phase 3: Complex Multi-Asset Settlement**

- Support for multi-leg trades and complex settlement patterns
- Advanced risk management and collateral optimization
- Full integration with traditional settlement infrastructure

## More Details

### Trade-offs

**Single vs Multi-Network Settlement:**

- Single Network: Simpler coordination, limited to network's liquidity/privacy characteristics
- Multi-Network: Optimized execution but increased coordination complexity
- **Recommendation:** Multi-network for institutional requirements, single-network for simpler use cases

**Trusted vs Trustless Coordination:**

- Trusted Relayers: Faster settlement, institutional relationships, centralization risks
- MPC/Trustless: Decentralized coordination, higher complexity, emerging technology
- **Recommendation:** Trusted relayers for initial deployment with MPC migration path

### Open Questions

1. **Cross-Network Finality:** How to handle different finality guarantees across networks in conditional settlement?

2. **Regulatory Harmonization:** Standardization of cross-border settlement reporting and compliance requirements?

3. **Liquidity Fragmentation:** Impact of privacy requirements on market liquidity and price discovery?

4. **Custodial Integration:** Standards for integrating privacy-preserving settlement with existing custodial infrastructure?

5. **Failure Recovery:** Operational procedures for handling complex multi-network settlement failures?

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Traditional HTLC Settlement**

- Use case: Simple atomic swaps without complex coordination
- Trade-off: Simpler implementation vs brittleness and limited institutional features
- Limitation: Lacks privacy preservation and institutional settlement patterns

**Pure On-Chain Settlement**

- Use case: Maximum transparency and composability
- Trade-off: Full on-chain visibility vs privacy requirements
- Limitation: Exposes all trading information publicly

**Centralized Settlement with Proof**

- Use case: High-performance settlement with cryptographic attestation
- Trade-off: Performance vs decentralization
- Pattern: Traditional settlement with ZK proofs of correct execution

## Example Scenarios

- **Cash Settlement:** USDC on Ethereum L1 (where liquidity exists)
- **Bond Transfer:** Private execution on Aztec L2 (for confidentiality)
- **Coordination:** ERC-7573 with trusted relayer ensuring atomicity across networks

- **Bonds:** Shielded pools for private bond transfers
- **Coordination:** MPC relayers coordinating across all three domains

### Scenario 3: Supply Chain Finance Settlement
