# Approach: Private Identity

## Problem framing

### Scenario

A bank needs to verify that counterparties and end users meet KYC, sanctions, and jurisdictional eligibility requirements without exposing personal data on chain or building cross-institutional dossiers. The same architecture must serve government registries, DAOs, and humanitarian programs whose users may be in jurisdictions where the issuer becomes unavailable, hostile, or destroyed.

### Requirements

- Verify eligibility claims without revealing the underlying identity
- Composable across credential sources (passport, national ID, email, web2 data, community attestation)
- Sybil resistance with per-identity cost curve (legitimate pseudonyms cheap, mass sybils expensive)
- Selective disclosure for regulators with scoped, time-bound access
- Issuer-independent verification path: on-chain trust anchor only, no issuer contact during verification

### Constraints

- Open-source verification logic; no canonical identity provider
- Proof generation practical on consumer hardware (mobile + browser)
- Revocation without re-identification
- Recovery from device loss or guardian compromise
- Coercion resistance for governance and humanitarian contexts

## Approaches

### Registry-Based Membership Proofs

```yaml
maturity: prototyped
context: i2i
crops: { cr: medium, o: yes, p: full, s: high }
uses_patterns: [pattern-private-mtp-auth, pattern-zk-kyc-ml-id-erc734-735, pattern-regulatory-disclosure-keys-proofs, pattern-voprf-nullifiers]
example_vendors: []
```

**Summary:** A registry operator maintains a Merkle tree of approved members; provers generate ZK membership proofs without revealing which leaf they correspond to.

**How it works:** The operator publishes an on-chain Merkle root commitment with an incremental tree. Members generate ZK proofs of inclusion in the membership tree and exclusion from a revocation tree, with scope-bound nullifiers preventing replay across verifiers. Contract hooks verify proofs and integrate with ERC-3643 token transfers; attestation logs (EAS) provide audit trails.

**Trust assumptions:**
- Registry operator(s) honesty and availability
- Merkle tree integrity and revocation correctness
- ZK soundness

**Threat model:**
- Registry operator censorship by omission or selective revocation
- Operator compromise reveals membership; mitigated by multi-operator registries
- Registry update latency creates verification windows

**Works best when:**
- Membership set is well-defined (institutional KYC list, DAO whitelist)
- Operator trust is administratively tractable (audited operations, multi-operator)
- Revocation cadence is bounded by governance, not adversarial pace

**Avoid when:**
- Registry operator failure must not break verification (use Issuer-Independent OPRF instead)
- Membership churn is high enough that revocation lag becomes a security problem

### Document ZK Proofs

```yaml
maturity: prototyped
context: both
crops: { cr: medium, o: yes, p: full, s: high }
uses_patterns: [pattern-noir-private-contracts]
example_vendors: []
```

**Summary:** ZK proofs over cryptographic data from government-issued identity documents (passport NFC, national ID signatures); selectively disclose attributes without revealing the document.

**How it works:** ZKPassport reads passport NFC chips (120+ countries) and proves attributes (age, nationality, sanctions-list non-membership) under Noir / UltraHonk on mobile. Anon Aadhaar verifies UIDAI's RSA signature client-side and emits EVM-verifiable proofs over Indian national ID attributes. The verifier checks the SNARK; no identity data is collected.

**Trust assumptions:**
- Document-issuing authority signature integrity
- Document cryptography (passport ICAO PA, UIDAI RSA) remains unbroken
- Mobile or NFC reader integrity at the client side

**Threat model:**
- Document issuer compromise propagates to all proofs
- Cloned passports / NFC replay; mitigated by document-side anti-cloning
- Mobile platform compromise reveals derivation material

**Works best when:**
- Attribute proofs are sufficient (sanctions, age, nationality) and full KYC is unnecessary
- User base has NFC-capable devices or supported national IDs
- Issuer cooperation persists for credential refresh

**Avoid when:**
- Issuer cooperation cannot be assumed long-term (use Issuer-Independent OPRF)
- Document cryptography is too weak or restricted for the threat model

### TLS Transcript Proofs

```yaml
maturity: prototyped
context: both
crops: { cr: medium, o: yes, p: partial, s: medium }
uses_patterns: [pattern-zk-tls]
example_vendors: []
```

**Summary:** TLSNotary generates ZK proofs over TLS session transcripts from any web2 source (bank portals, government sites, social media); selectively discloses specific fields.

**How it works:** A Notary co-signs the TLS session; the prover holds the session transcript and generates a ZK proof attesting to specific fields (account balance, government registry record, social signal). The verifier checks the proof against the Notary's signature and the TLS session metadata.

**Trust assumptions:**
- Notary honesty and availability during the session
- TLS server certificate validity
- Web2 data source not adversarial during the session

**Threat model:**
- Notary compromise corrupts the witnessing function
- TLS server-side data manipulation between sessions
- Disclosure granularity limited by TLS record structure

**Works best when:**
- Web2 data source has no API for direct attestation
- Notary trust is administratively manageable (audited, multi-notary, or threshold)
- Freshness expectation is bounded by session timing

**Avoid when:**
- Trusted Notary is incompatible with the threat model
- Required disclosure granularity is below TLS record boundaries

### On-Chain Attestation

```yaml
maturity: production
context: both
crops: { cr: medium, o: yes, p: partial, s: medium }
uses_patterns: [pattern-verifiable-attestation, pattern-zk-wrappers, pattern-erc3643-rwa]
example_vendors: []
```

**Summary:** Trusted issuers publish signed claims on chain (EAS, ONCHAINID via ERC-734/735, W3C VCs); ZK wrappers (OpenAC) add unlinkable presentation across verifiers.

**How it works:** Issuers sign attestations under known keys and publish them on chain. Verifiers reference the attestation and check the issuer signature. With ZK wrappers like OpenAC, the holder presents a proof of attestation possession with selective disclosure, unlinkable across verifiers; no trusted setup, EUDI ARF compatible.

**Trust assumptions:**
- Issuer signing key custody and lifecycle (rotation, revocation)
- Attestation registry availability and correctness
- ZK wrapper soundness (OpenAC) where unlinkability is required

**Threat model:**
- Issuer key compromise enables unauthorized attestations
- Without ZK presentation, verifier-to-verifier linkability via issuer reference
- Attestation revocation must reach all verifiers; staleness creates verification gaps

**Works best when:**
- Permissioned token compliance (ERC-3643), cross-institutional credential sharing
- Issuer governance is mature and audit-ready
- Unlinkability across verifiers is a goal, pair with OpenAC

**Avoid when:**
- Issuer cooperation cannot be assumed long-term (use Issuer-Independent OPRF)
- Verifiers must not be able to correlate via shared issuer references and OpenAC is unavailable

### POD2

```yaml
maturity: prototyped
context: both
crops: { cr: high, o: yes, p: full, s: medium }
uses_patterns: [pattern-private-mtp-auth]
example_vendors: []
```

**Summary:** POD2 (Provable Object Data) bundles any data with a cryptographic proof of correctness; event tickets, community badges, poll responses, and access tokens share a composable format.

**How it works:** Each POD is a typed record signed by the issuer; verifiers check the signature and the typed schema. PODs compose: a holder can prove statements over multiple PODs in a single ZK proof (e.g., "I hold an event POD and a community POD without revealing which event or community").

**Trust assumptions:**
- POD issuer signing keys
- Schema integrity at the ecosystem level
- Composability framework (POD2 library) correctness

**Threat model:**
- Issuer key compromise corrupts all PODs from that issuer
- Schema collision or malleability across communities
- Tooling maturity affects audit confidence

**Works best when:**
- Event gating, community membership, anonymous polls, sybil-resistant access
- Composable credential ecosystems where heterogeneous attestations interoperate
- Community-driven adoption is acceptable

**Avoid when:**
- Institutional-grade audit and assurance is required (community tooling is less mature than EAS / ONCHAINID)

### Issuer-Independent Enrollment via Distributed OPRF

```yaml
maturity: prototyped
context: both
crops: { cr: high, o: yes, p: full, s: high }
uses_patterns: [pattern-private-mtp-auth, pattern-voprf-nullifiers, pattern-regulatory-disclosure-keys-proofs, pattern-verifiable-attestation, pattern-social-recovery]
example_vendors: []
```

**Summary:** Holders prove identity to a threshold vOPRF network, yielding a deterministic enrollment nullifier and a Poseidon leaf in an on-chain LeanIMT; post-enrollment, the on-chain root is the sole trust anchor, no issuer contact during verification.

**How it works:** Any A-E source can enroll (passport, national ID, email DKIM, TLS notary, biometric, community vouch). The holder runs RFC 9497 + Jarecki threshold OPRF against the network (TACEO operates a 13-node production network). Output: a deterministic enrollment nullifier and a leaf added to the on-chain LeanIMT. Verification at any verifier checks a ZK proof against the on-chain root with public inputs (root, scope-bound nullifier, predicate parameters). Sybil resistance is layered: cryptographic (one enrollment per source credential), economic (refundable stake, default 0.1 ETH), social (web-of-trust vouching, future). Recovery via Shamir threshold splitting and guardian-based social recovery.

**Trust assumptions:**
- Threshold OPRF network availability (t-of-n liveness)
- Source credential cryptography for enrollment
- On-chain LeanIMT integrity
- Recovery custodian / guardian set independence

**Threat model:**
- OPRF operators accumulate enrollment metadata; mitigated by anonymous communication
- Source-credential compromise enables sybil enrollment from that source; mitigated by economic stake and layered sources
- Predicate parameters are public PoC inputs (production: private predicate circuits)
- Coercion-resistant recovery is an open question

**Works best when:**
- Issuer may become unavailable, hostile, or destroyed
- Sanctions compliance must persist across jurisdictional disruptions
- Multi-source enrollment with issuer-free verification is required

**Avoid when:**
- Single-issuer cooperation is reliable and the operational simplicity of A-D is preferred
- Threshold OPRF network operation cannot meet jurisdictional independence requirements

## Persona perspectives

### Business perspective

For institutional KYC, sanctions compliance, and ERC-3643 permissioned token transfers, **On-Chain Attestation** with EAS and ONCHAINID is the production-default; pair with **OpenAC** for cross-verifier unlinkability where the issuer-linkage signal is competitively sensitive. **Registry Membership** suits well-defined institutional whitelists where the operator is administratively tractable. **Document ZK** wins for sanctions and age verification where attribute-only proofs are sufficient and full KYC is overhead. **Issuer-Independent OPRF** is the right call when issuer continuity is a documented risk: institutions in sanctioned jurisdictions, humanitarian programs, or governance contexts where the issuer cannot remain available indefinitely.

### Technical perspective

Engineering effort scales by approach. Registry Membership reuses Semaphore-class infrastructure with the lowest proof cost. Document ZK requires mobile NFC integration plus Noir or Circom circuits per document type. TLS Transcript Proofs add the Notary infrastructure and TLS-record introspection. On-Chain Attestation is the simplest verification surface (signature check) but requires registry hygiene at the issuer. POD2 is composable across heterogeneous attestations but the tooling is community-driven. Issuer-Independent OPRF is the heaviest engineering surface (threshold network, on-chain LeanIMT, recovery infrastructure) but is the only category that survives single-issuer failure.

### Legal & risk perspective

Each approach has a distinct disclosure interface. Registry Membership uses scoped view keys and EAS-logged audit trails; the registry operator is the named regulated party. Document ZK proofs disclose only the attribute predicate's public output; jurisdictional acceptance varies (ZKPassport validated at Aztec sale across OFAC / Swiss / EU / UK). TLS Transcript Proofs require legal classification of the Notary's role. On-Chain Attestation maps cleanly onto existing identity-issuer regulation; OpenAC adds unlinkability without breaking the audit trail. POD2 is community-grade and may not satisfy institutional-grade evidence standards. Issuer-Independent OPRF requires legal sign-off on the threshold network composition, the recovery model, and the coercion-resistance posture.

## Recommendation

### Default

For institutional permissioned-asset access today, default to **On-Chain Attestation** with EAS and ONCHAINID; add **OpenAC** when cross-verifier unlinkability matters. For institutional KYC whitelists with operator-controlled membership, default to **Registry Membership Proofs** (Semaphore-class). For sanctions and age verification on a global user base, default to **Document ZK** (ZKPassport) on supported documents.

### Decision factors

- If issuer continuity is a documented risk (sanctions, jurisdictional disruption, humanitarian context), choose **Issuer-Independent OPRF** and design the threshold network for jurisdictional diversity.
- If web2 data sources without APIs must be brought on chain, choose **TLS Transcript Proofs** and validate the Notary governance.
- If the ecosystem requires composable attestations across heterogeneous communities, choose **POD2** and accept the community-tooling maturity trade-off.

### Hybrid

Run On-Chain Attestation as the default for production permissioned flows; layer Document ZK for sanctions screening at the entry boundary; enroll high-risk users (institutions in jurisdictionally exposed locations, humanitarian recipients) into the Issuer-Independent OPRF as a continuity backup. Recovery uses Shamir + guardian quorum across the same enrollment. Coercion-resistance posture is documented per program; production-grade anti-coercion mechanism is an open research item.

## Open questions

1. **Multi-Address Efficiency.** Proving ownership of multiple EOAs from the same seed without revealing derivation patterns.
2. **Regulatory Recognition.** Legal recognition of ZK proofs as sufficient compliance evidence per jurisdiction.
3. **Notary Trust.** Guaranteeing Notary trustworthiness in zk-TLS deployments; threshold or audited Notary networks.
4. **Cross-Credential Composability.** Combining proofs from heterogeneous sources (passport + KYC attestation + community POD) in a single verification.
5. **Credential Revocation.** Revocation across heterogeneous issuers without a central authority.
6. **Guardian Recovery Design.** Minimum guardian set for anti-coercion; acceptable coordination overhead for quorum recovery.
7. **Attribute Freshness.** Without an issuer to refresh, how stale attributes (expired passports, changed nationality) are handled in OPRF-anchored enrollment.
