# Approaches

**What this is.** Detailed solution approaches that combine multiple patterns to address specific use case problems. Each approach provides architecture recommendations, design choices, and trade-offs tailored to different personas (business, technical, legal).

**How to use.** When a use case requires combining multiple patterns and making specific design choices, create an approach document using the template below. Link back to the specific use case and reference relevant patterns.

- Template: [`_template.md`](./_template.md)
- Naming: `approach-<use-case-slug>.md` (kebab-case)
- Structure: Overview → Architecture → Trade-offs → Links

**Relationship to patterns:** Patterns are reusable building blocks; approaches explain how to combine them for specific scenarios with detailed recommendations and trade-off analysis.
