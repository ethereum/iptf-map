# Fairblock — Cross-chain Confidential Transfers (lightweight homomorphic ops + ZK)

## What it is

Fairblock provides confidential balances and transfers for assets (e.g., stablecoins) that remain issued and liquid on an originating chain (e.g., EVM networks), while confidentiality logic executes on **FairyRing**, a purpose-built confidentiality execution layer.

The core idea is a cross-chain confidential layer: users lock tokens into a minimal smart contract on the originating chain, receive an encrypted balance maintained by FairyRing, and execute confidential transfers backed by ZK proofs and homomorphic balance updates, then optionally withdraw back to the originating chain.

## Fits with patterns

- [Selective disclosure (viewing keys + ZK proofs)](../patterns/pattern-regulatory-disclosure-keys-proofs.md): scoped disclosure for audit and compliance workflows

## Not a substitute for

- Anonymity, mixers, or large anonymity sets: Fairblock focuses on amount and balance confidentiality, not obfuscasting participant identities by default.
- Stealth addresses (unlinkable recipients): requires separate stealth address infrastructure if counterparty unlinkability is required.
- Full transaction graph privacy: relationship metadata may still be inferable depending on integration design.

## Architecture

High-level components:

1. Origin chain (e.g., EVM): Minimal locking smart contract
   - Locks/unlocks the underlying ERC-20 tokens
   - User-facing interface for deposit/transfer/withdraw flows
2. FairyRing: confidentiality execution layer
   - CosmWasm contracts maintain an encrypted chain
   - Verifies ZK proofs for valid encrypted state transitions
   - Performs lightweight homomorphic add/subtract for balance updates
3. Cross-chain messaging (IBC-style)
   - Relays packets between the origin chain and FairyRing
   - Relayers transport packets but are not intended to be trusted for correctness

## Privacy domains

Encrypted (intended):

- Amounts and balances (encrypted state)

Public (intended):

- Sender and receiver addresses (confidentiality, not anonymity)
- Existence and timing of origin-chain transactions that invoke the locking contract

## Selective disclosure (compliance posture)

FairyRing supports selective disclosure for audits and investigations via scoped decryption access using threshold identity-based encryption (IBE), aiming to avoid a single persistent global audit key

## Enterprise demand and use cases

- Treasury operations: encrypt balances and flows while keeping counterparties known and auditable
- Payroll and vendor payouts: amount confidentiality with the ability to disclose specific transactions when required
- B2B payment rails: confidentiality layer for regulated payment operations that still require reporting and audit

## Technical details (as described publicly)

- Cross-chain design connecting an origin chain locking contract with FairyRing as confidentiality layer
- Encrypted layer and ZK proof verification for valid state transitions
- Lightweight homomorphic operations for balance updates
- Threshold IBE for scoped selective disclosure

## Strengths

- Preserves existing asset issuance and liquidity on EVM chains (no token contract changes required)
- Clear compliance posture via scoped selective disclosure (IBE-based); avoids a single persistent audit key
- Security: avoids off-chain coprocessing, single-TEE trust models, MPC honest-majority assumptions, and external prover service dependencies (proof generation is local)
- Performance/UX: no bridging of funds and no new wallet behavior; lightweight cryptography targets low latency flows (vs. long proof delays common in many privacy systems)

## Risks and open questions

- Relationship privacy is optional: the default model prioritizes confidentiality (amounts/balances) with traceable addresses; deployments that need relationship obfuscation/anonymity can layer additional primitives, but that typically increases complexity/latency and may introduce stricter compliance requirements that not all partners want
- Cross-chain messaging (liveness, not custody): messaging mainly impacts availabiilty and UX (e.g., delayed credits or withdrawals). Funds remain locked on the original chain; messaging failtures should not imply loss of funds, but operational reliability and integration monitoring still matter
- Locking smart contract: the origin-chain locking contract is a critical component
- Disclosure governance: “who can request or approve disclosure, under what policy, and how it’s audited” must be specified in deployments
