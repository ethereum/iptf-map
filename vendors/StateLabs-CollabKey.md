## State Labs â€“ Collab-Key
**Type:** MPC-TSS Key Management and Signing Infrastructure  
**Category:** Custody / Key Management  

**Description:**  
Collab-Key is a high-performance MPC-TSS framework supporting both two-party and multi-party ECDSA signing.
Keys are generated and used collaboratively through secure computation and threshold signatures, ensuring that no single participant ever reconstructs a full private key.
It integrates seamlessly with existing KMS systems and client applications, delivering fast, production-grade signing for institutional wallets and custody providers.

Collab-Key builds upon our team's peer-reviewed research published at **USENIX Security 2025**, including:  
- *Improved Secure Two-party Computation from a Geometric Perspective*  
- *Achilles: A Formal Framework of Leaking Secrets from Signature Schemes via Rowhammer* (Honorable Mention)


These works form the cryptographic foundation behind Collab-Key's design, combining academic rigor with real-world performance.

**Tech Stack:**  
MPC, TSS (ECDSA 2PC / multi-party), Threshold Signatures
