## State Labs â€“ OpenTMP LLM (Collaborative Private AI)
**Type:** Distributed Edge AI Training and Inferences & Privacy Framework for Collaborative AI  
**Category:** Private LLM AI 

**Description:**  
OpenTMP LLM enables efficient, secure and privacy-preserving large language model training and inference across distributed environments.  
It combines federated learning and multi-party computation (MPC-FL) to keep data local while performing encrypted aggregation and joint model updates.  
Modules include **Private LLM** (confidential local training & inference), **Efficient LLM** (edge acceleration, distillation, quantization), and **Governable LLM** (MPC-based joint training and shared governance) for scalable, compliant collaboration.

**Tech Stack:**  
MPC-FL, Distributed Learning, Edge AI Acceleration, SFT, RLHF
