title: "Pattern: Private Client Authentication for Institutional EOAs"
status: draft
maturity: pilot
works-best-when:
  - Institutions must comply with KYC/AML but want to protect client privacy onchain.
  - Clients need to prove control of EOAs without revealing identity.
  - Multi-address support is desired (same seed, different EOAs).
avoid-when:
  - Regulators require explicit PII disclosure onchain.
  - Institutions lack capacity to manage ZK infrastructure or Merkle registry.
dependencies: [ERC-3643, EIP-7573, EAS, Semaphore, MTP, ZK-Proofs]

## Intent

Enable institutions to authenticate client EOAs in a way that satisfies regulatory KYC/AML requirements while preserving privacy. This pattern uses **Merkle tree membership proofs** (e.g., via Semaphore) so clients can demonstrate inclusion in an approved/KYC’d registry without revealing identity or linking other addresses.

## Ingredients

- **Standards/ER(C|IP)s**: ERC-3643 (permissioned tokens), EAS (attestation registry).
- **Infra**: Ethereum L1/L2s, wallet, ZK circuits for Merkle membership proofs.
- **Off-chain services**: KYC registries, institutional Merkle tree builder, key management systems, On-chain contract to maintain MT root.

## Protocol (concise)

1. Client undergoes KYC off-chain with institution or distributor.
2. Institution inserts client EOA into a Merkle tree of approved addresses; commits root onchain.
3. Client wallet generates a **Semaphore proof**: Merkle membership + nullifier (anti-replay) + private key control.
4. Proof submitted to institution’s contract or off-chain verifier.
5. Institution verifies ZK proof; accepts EOA as authenticated.
6. (Future) Clients prove multiple EOAs derive from same seed via multi-ownership extension.
7. Regulators/auditors can verify tree updates and proof validity without learning which leaf belongs to whom.

## Guarantees

- **Hides**: identity, KYC details, linkage between EOAs.
- **Proves**: KYC membership, private key control, non-reusability (via nullifiers).
- **Atomicity**: proof verification and transaction execution tied.
- **Audit**: regulator can validate registry and roots without deanonymizing clients.

## Trade-offs

- **Performance/cost**: ZK proof generation adds latency; tree updates must be frequent.
- **DX**: client wallets need Semaphore/ZK integration.
- **Limitations**: current Semaphore-style MT proofs don’t support efficient multi-ownership (same seed, many EOAs).

## Example

- The bank runs a KYC registry; inserts approved EOAs into a Merkle tree.
- Client generates a Semaphore proof showing inclusion in the tree.
- The bank contract validates the proof before processing a tokenized security transfer.
- Observers see the transaction but cannot link EOA to a specific client or discover other addresses.
- Regulator can later audit the registry root and inclusion proof.
