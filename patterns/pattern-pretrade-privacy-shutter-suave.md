title: "Pattern: Pre-trade privacy (Shutter/SUAVE/private RFQ)"
status: ready
maturity: pilot
works-best-when:
  - RFQ/secondary trading must not leak intent, size, or price pre-inclusion.
avoid-when:
  - You accept public mempool visibility of orders.
dependencies:
  - Encrypted mempool (Shutter) or private builders (SUAVE)
  - RFQ service
---

## Intent
Prevent **front-running and information leakage** by routing quotes/orders via **encrypted/private submission**; then settle with confidential tokens.

## Ingredients
- **Infra**: Shutter/SUAVE, allow-listed counterparties
- **Off-chain**: RFQ broker, audit of quote requests

## Protocol (concise)
1. Buyer emits RFQ off-chain; quotes returned privately.
2. Winning order submitted via encrypted route for inclusion.
3. Settlement occurs on privacy L2/L1 pool; amounts remain hidden.

## Guarantees
- No public mempool leakage of intent/size/price.
- Auditable RFQ lifecycle.

## Trade-offs
- Additional infra dependency; fallback path required.
- Latency/availability tied to privacy routing.

## Example
- Three quotes received; best quote settles; unfilled quotes remain undisclosed.
