One short paragraph: the job this pattern does.

## Protocol (concise)
Numbered steps (5–8 max) from intent → settlement/audit.

## Guarantees
- What it hides / proves
- Atomicity / finality
- Audit & ops signal

## Trade-offs
- Performance / cost / DX notes
- Failure modes & mitigations

## Example
“Bank A sells €5m zero-coupon to Bank B…” — 3–5 bullets showing flow.
