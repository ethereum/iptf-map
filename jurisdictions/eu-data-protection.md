## At a Glance

The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) establish data protection obligations that apply to crypto entities alongside MiCA requirements. While MiCA regulates crypto-asset service providers, GDPR governs personal data processing, and DORA addresses ICT resilience and incident reporting. This card highlights the intersection of these frameworks and emerging privacy-enhancing technology discussions.

## Core Compliance Expectations

- **Data minimisation**: Under GDPR Articles 5–6, entities must collect only what is necessary for defined purposes and document lawful basis for processing.
- **Cross-border data transfers**: Use adequacy decisions or Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers outside the EU.
- **Incident reporting**: DORA Articles 17–19 require reporting of major ICT incidents to competent authorities.
- **Privacy-enhancing technologies**: Zero-knowledge proofs and secure computation techniques are increasingly discussed as potential tools for balancing data protection with regulatory obligations.

## Key Risks to Watch

- **Regulatory ambiguity on anonymisation vs pseudonymisation**: Classification affects whether GDPR applies (see EDPB Guidelines 01/2025).
- **Divergent national interpretations**: Member State authorities may differ on whether privacy-enhancing approaches satisfy AML record-keeping requirements.
- **Right to erasure vs blockchain immutability**: GDPR Article 17 creates challenges for immutable ledger architectures (see EDPB Guidelines 02/2025).

## Enterprise Opportunities

- **First-mover advantage in privacy-preserving compliance**: Institutions that pilot privacy-enhancing technologies (selective disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs) for KYC/AML may differentiate themselves as regulatory frameworks evolve.
- **MiCA passporting with GDPR readiness**: CASPs demonstrating robust cross-border data governance can leverage MiCA's single-market passport more effectively across Member States.
- **Institutional trust through transparency**: Public documentation of GDPR-DORA compliance frameworks signals operational maturity to institutional counterparties and NCAs.
