## At a Glance

## Core Compliance Expectations

- **Registration / licensing**: what entities must register.
- **KYC/AML**: baseline obligations.
- **Disclosure / reporting**: what must be filed/shared.
- **Custody rules**: if relevant.

## Actionable Best Practices

- Best practices for institutional exchanges.

### Funds & Assets

- ETP/ETF approvals, fund registration, disclosure standards.
- How enterprises should structure products.

### Custody

## Key Risks to Watch
