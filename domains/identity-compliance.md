title: "Domain: Identity & Compliance"
status: draft
---

## TLDR
- KYC/AML credentials, allow/deny, accreditation, attestations, revocation.
- Public verification without publishing PII; scoped disclosure for regulators.

## Primary use cases
- (Cross-cut; applied in all domains as a prerequisite)

## Shortest-path patterns
- zk-KYC/ML + ONCHAINID (ERC-734-735) (`/patterns/pattern-zk-kyc-ml-id-erc734-735.md`)
- Selective disclosure (view keys + proofs) (`/patterns/pattern-regulatory-disclosure-keys-proofs.md`)
- Crypto-registry bridge (eWpG) + EAS (`/patterns/pattern-crypto-registry-bridge-eWpG-eas.md`)

## Adjacent vendors
- Chainlink ACE (`/vendors/chainlink-ace.md`)
