## TLDR
- Wallet ops/KMS/HSM, freeze/blacklist controls, segregation, recovery, post-trade hooks.
- Governed regulator access (view keys / proofs) and evidence logging.

## Primary use cases
- (Cross-cut; referenced by Payments and Funds & Assets flows)

## Shortest-path patterns
- Selective disclosure (view keys + proofs) (`/patterns/pattern-regulatory-disclosure-keys-proofs.md`)
- Atomic DvP via ERC-7573 (`/patterns/pattern-dvp-erc7573.md`)

## Adjacent vendors
- Kaleido Paladin (`/vendors/kaleido-paladin.md`)
