# IPTF Map - Q2 2026 QA Audit

> **Goal:** Every content file in the map read and reviewed by a human. Main targets: slop and incoherences.
> **Period:** Q2 2026 (April - June)
> **Where:** All audit work happens on the `feat/audit` branch ([PR #130](https://github.com/ethereum/iptf-map/pull/130)).

## How the audit works (claim and reveal)

The tracker below is the single source of truth for who is reviewing what. Claim before you review so nobody duplicates work.

1. **Pull first:** `git pull origin feat/audit` to see the latest claims.
2. **Claim a batch:** pick 5-10 `pending` files (or a whole small section). Flip their rows to `claimed`, add your GitHub handle and the date in the Claimed column. Commit and push immediately so the claim is visible to others.
3. **Review the files** on this branch, against the checklist below.
4. **Small problems** (typos, wording, small incoherences): fix them directly. Commit the content fix together with the tracker flip to `ok`, and note what you fixed.
5. **Big problems** (needs refactor, structural incoherence, doubtful content): flip the row to `needs-fix`, open a GitHub issue and link it in the Notes column. Flip to `ok` once the issue is resolved.
6. **Uncertainties** (you cannot verify a notion or construction): add a row to [Open Questions](#open-questions) so it gets resolved or escalated before the audit closes.

**Stale claims:** a `claimed` row untouched for 7+ days may be reclaimed by someone else.

**Keeping the tracker in sync:** `node scripts/audit-sync.js` checks the file list against `origin/master` (run `git fetch origin master` first); `node scripts/audit-sync.js --sync` adds new files as `pending` and recomputes the summary without touching existing review data. CI runs the check on every push to `feat/audit`.

### Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Not yet claimed |
| `claimed` | Someone is reviewing it (see Reviewer and Claimed columns) |
| `ok` | Reviewed, fine as is or fixed inline |
| `needs-fix` | Reviewed, big issue flagged, resolution tracked in Notes |
| `deprecated` | File removed or content obsolete |

### What to check per file

The mechanical checks (frontmatter, word limits, link validity) are covered by `npm run validate` and CI. The human pass is for what scripts cannot catch:

- [ ] **Technical accuracy**: mechanisms are described correctly, no fabricated or unverifiable claims, no outdated statements presented as current
- [ ] **Internal coherence**: frontmatter matches the body, sections do not contradict each other, the example actually illustrates the pattern
- [ ] **Cross-doc coherence**: links point to the right documents and make sense in context, terminology matches [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md), no contradictions with related patterns/approaches
- [ ] **Slop**: generic filler, vague attributions ("experts agree", "many institutions"), marketing tone, unsupported superlatives, lists that pad instead of inform
- [ ] **Template conformance**: content follows its directory `_template.md` in structure and intent

## Structural / Meta Checks

These are one-time checks on the overall map integrity:

| Check | Status | Reviewer | Date | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|------|-------|
| GLOSSARY.md - all terms accurate | `ok` | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-24 | glossary definitions reviewed/accurate; per-card terminology-variant consistency (e.g. ZK proof→zero-knowledge proof, ERC3643→ERC-3643; 18 hits/11 files, mostly vendors) is a known separate backlog |
| README.md - navigation links valid | `ok` | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-24 | all 8 root nav links resolve |
| CONTRIBUTING.md - up to date | `ok` | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-24 | CROPS rubric retained (used by patterns/approaches); vendor docs keep CROPS as a curation guideline — no change needed (Q6) |
| All internal cross-links resolve | `ok` | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-24 | content links resolve after l2-eval cleanup; intentional non-resolving refs left as-is — template/example placeholders (rfps/_template.md, CONTRIBUTING.md), historical CHANGELOG release links to since-removed content (l2-eval/survey/weekly-updates; past releases are immutable), QA-AUDIT deprecated-row link (tracker bookkeeping) |
| No orphan files (unreferenced content) | `ok` | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-24 | reviewed — prose-link "orphans" are mostly frontmatter/README-reachable (taxonomy); approach-white-label-deployment flagged for a use-case backlink (backlog) |
| Frontmatter schema validation passes | `ok` | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-24 | `validate-patterns.js` passes (only content word-count warnings) |
| Vale linting passes on all files | `ok` | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-24 | 0 errors; ~196 advisory warnings (IPTF.Marketing / IPTF.Terminology) → prose-sweep backlog |

## Open Questions

Questions, uncertainties, or decisions that surface during the audit. Resolve or escalate before closing the audit.

| # | Question | Raised by | Date | Related file(s) | Resolution |
|---|----------|-----------|------|------------------|------------|
| 1 | Is `maturity: production` applied consistently? It sits on an offchain pattern with no mainnet usage (mesh) and recent frameworks (OIF). What is the rubric for non-onchain patterns? | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-17 | [pattern-mesh-store-forward-submission.md](patterns/pattern-mesh-store-forward-submission.md), [pattern-oif.md](patterns/pattern-oif.md) | 2026-06-18: related data point — compliance-monitoring + cross-chain-privacy-bridge re-tiered testnet→concept (empty impls, generic archetypes). Production-tier rubric for non-onchain patterns still open. **Resolved 2026-06-24:** rubric = judge the primitive's maturity in the Ethereum context — mesh-store-forward-submission `production`→`concept` (no Ethereum-context implementation); OIF kept `production` (ERC-7683 intents live via Across/UniswapX). |
| 2 | Should `pattern-l2-privacy-evaluation` stay in `patterns/` or move to `approaches/` (or a methodology doc)? It is an evaluation framework (crops_profile `n/a`, table-driven), not a reusable privacy primitive — the card self-flags this. | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-18 | pattern-l2-privacy-evaluation.md _(removed)_ | **Resolved 2026-06-24:** removed from the map (maintainer decision). Cleaned 3 `see_also` refs + 2 rfp-benchmark-dashboard links; tracker row 18 → `deprecated`. Historical CHANGELOG [0.3.0] entry left intact (past releases are immutable). |
| 3 | `private-iso20022` See-also links to iso20022.org (message-definitions, `supplementary_data.page`) could not be verified — iso20022.org blocks automated fetchers (curl 000, WebFetch timeout) and the `.page` URL looks legacy. Needs a manual browser check, or repoint to the iso20022.org catalogue root. | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-18 | [pattern-private-iso20022.md](patterns/pattern-private-iso20022.md) | **Resolved 2026-06-24:** kept the message-definitions link; repointed the legacy `supplementary_data.page` link to the iso20022.org catalogue root (stable). |
| 4 | EPIC map demo link (`epic-webapp.vercel.app`) is referenced from 7 use-cases but is a Vercel preview URL (linkrot risk). Repoint to a stable/canonical URL, or confirm this is the canonical partner location. | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-19 | private-government-debt, private-payments, private-identity, private-registry, private-oracles, private-procurement, private-supply-chain | **Resolved 2026-06-24:** `epic-webapp.vercel.app` confirmed canonical by maintainer; kept across the 7 use-cases. |
| 5 | Use-case `status`: the 14 former stubs are now `ready`, but the 9 complete/resilient files carry no `status` and the use-case `_template.md` omits it. Standardize (add `status: ready` to all + document in template) or keep `status` optional? | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-19 | [use-cases/_template.md](use-cases/_template.md) | Resolved 2026-06-19: `status: ready` on all 23 + added to `_template.md`; titles also normalized (unquoted, `(ERC-6123)` dropped from derivatives title) |
| 6 | Dropped `## CROPS profile` from the vendor template + removed peer's inline CROPS (per decision), but the vendor [README](vendors/README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING § CROPS Evaluation](CONTRIBUTING.md#crops-evaluation) still present CROPS as the core vendor-evaluation framework. Reconcile the README/CONTRIBUTING, or reintroduce CROPS in another form? | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-19 | [vendors/README.md](vendors/README.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) | **Resolved 2026-06-24:** keep CROPS as a curation guideline in the vendor docs (vendors/README + CONTRIBUTING left intact). The reconciliation is the already-completed drop of the *per-card* CROPS profile from the vendor template; the docs may reference CROPS as a selection guideline without per-card scoring. |
| 7 | Some approaches list `primary_patterns` that no sub-approach `uses_patterns` references — dvp-atomic-settlement (`pattern-commit-and-prove`), private-payments (`pattern-private-iso20022`, `pattern-private-stablecoin-shielded-payments`). The template's subset rule is satisfied, but a *primary* pattern unused by every sub-approach is odd. Demote to supporting, or accept primaries as thematic anchors? | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-24 | [approach-dvp-atomic-settlement.md](approaches/approach-dvp-atomic-settlement.md), [approach-private-payments.md](approaches/approach-private-payments.md) | **Resolved 2026-06-24:** demoted the unused primaries to supporting — dvp (commit-and-prove); payments (private-iso20022, private-stablecoin-shielded-payments). |
| 8 | Throughput figures in co-SNARK / FHE sub-approaches (`~200 TPS` co-SNARK, `500-1000 TPS` FHE in bonds; PoC benchmarks in payments) are stated as fact but trace to IPTF PoCs / vendor claims and were not independently verifiable in this pass. Add explicit sourcing or qualify as PoC-measured? Also: "Trusted setup is not required (UltraHonk)" recurs map-wide but UltraHonk uses a universal KZG SRS — precise wording is "no per-circuit trusted setup". | Meyanis95 | 2026-06-24 | [approach-private-bonds.md](approaches/approach-private-bonds.md), [approach-private-derivatives.md](approaches/approach-private-derivatives.md) | **Resolved 2026-06-24:** qualified co-SNARK ~200 TPS (TACEO-reported) + FHE 500-1000 TPS (vendor-reported) in bonds/derivatives; fixed "trusted setup not required (UltraHonk)" → "no per-circuit trusted setup (universal KZG SRS)" in bonds + payments; corrected the zk-wrappers UltraHonk transparency claim. |
