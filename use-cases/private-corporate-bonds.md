## 1) Use Case

Corporate debt issuance where companies raising capital need to hide financing activity from competitors, employees, and market observers. Unlike public/government bonds, corporate bond issuance reveals strategic information about funding needs and potential credit stress.

See [private-bonds.md](private-bonds.md) for general bond patterns. Corporate bonds have specific privacy requirements around hiding funding signals from competitors.

## 2) Additional Business Context

**See confidential context:** [context/use-cases/context-private-corporate-bonds.md](../../context/use-cases/context-private-corporate-bonds.md)

## 3) Actors

Corporate Issuer · Underwriters · Investors · Crypto-Registry · Regulator

## 4) Problems

### Problem 1: Funding Signal Leakage

Public bond issuance reveals that a company is raising capital, which competitors can use to infer financial stress, acquisition plans, or strategic moves. Employees may also react negatively to perceived funding needs.

**Requirements:**

- **Must hide:** Issuance timing, amounts, pricing negotiations, investor identities (during process)
- **Public OK:** Legal entity identity (post-close where required); existence of debt facility (where mandated by securities law)
- **Regulator access:** Selective disclosure to securities regulators; audit trail for compliance

**Constraints:**

- Securities law disclosure requirements vary by jurisdiction (private placement vs public offering)
- Secondary trading privacy distinct from issuance privacy
- Timeline sensitivity: stealth rounds require extended confidentiality

### Problem 2: Competitive Intelligence from Secondary Trading

Post-issuance trading activity reveals investor sentiment, credit quality perceptions, and potential refinancing needs.

**Requirements:**

- **Must hide:** Trading volumes, prices, counterparties
- **Public OK:** Existence of secondary market activity
- **Regulator access:** Trade reporting for market surveillance

**Constraints:**

- Liquidity requirements for bondholders
- Mark-to-market valuation needs

## 5) Recommended Approaches

See [approach-private-bonds.md](../approaches/approach-private-bonds.md) for general bond architecture. Corporate-specific considerations:

- Extended confidentiality periods for stealth rounds
- Employee communication timing coordination
- Competitor monitoring countermeasures

## 6) Open Questions

- How do disclosure requirements differ between private placements vs public offerings across jurisdictions?
- What's the minimum viable privacy: amounts only, or full term sheet confidentiality?
- How long must confidentiality be maintained post-close?
