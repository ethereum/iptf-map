# Use Cases

**What this is.** One-page briefs that define a business problem, evidence, requirements, and acceptance criteriaâ€”then point to recommended approaches. Use cases drive decisions; patterns and approaches explain *how*.

**How to use.** Create a new file per scenario using the template below. Be clear on what must be private, regulator access, and DvP/finality needs. Link only the most relevant patterns and approaches; capture the decision and next steps.

- Template: [`_template.md`](./_template.md)
- Scope: keep to a single page; move deep context to linked docs
- Outcome: a checked acceptance list and a chosen approach with a PoC plan

**Confidential information.** Business-sensitive details (specific organizations, pilot scopes, committed volumes) are maintained in the `context/` folder with corresponding context files. Each use case links to its confidential context document.

Use cases should be stable over time; patterns and approaches may evolve underneath as the tech matures.
