## 1) Use Case

Cross-border foreign exchange settlement on blockchain where trading intent, positions, and execution details must remain confidential. FX is one of the largest financial markets; 99% of stablecoins are USD-backed, making cross-currency settlement a natural blockchain application. Institutions require privacy to prevent front-running and protect trading strategies.

## 2) Additional Business Context

**Confidential context:** Available in private IPTF repo

## 3) Actors

Banks · Payment Networks · Corporate Treasury · Liquidity Providers · Regulators · Stablecoin Issuers

## 4) Problems

### Problem 1: Trading Intent and Front-Running Prevention

FX markets are highly competitive with tight spreads. Leaked trading intent enables front-running and adverse price movements.

**Requirements:**

- **Must hide:** Order size, direction, timing, counterparty relationships
- **Public OK:** General market liquidity, executed trade existence (after settlement)
- **Regulator access:** Trade reporting for market surveillance; sanctions screening

**Constraints:**

- Real-time settlement requirements
- Liquidity fragmentation across stablecoin venues
- Regulatory reporting obligations (EMIR, Dodd-Frank)

### Problem 2: Cross-Border Settlement Privacy

International payments reveal business relationships and transaction patterns that competitors can exploit.

**Requirements:**

- **Must hide:** Payment amounts, sender/receiver identities, payment purpose
- **Public OK:** Settlement finality confirmation
- **Regulator access:** AML/CFT monitoring; cross-border transaction reporting

**Constraints:**

- Multi-jurisdictional compliance requirements
- Correspondent banking relationships
- SWIFT alternative positioning

## 5) Recommended Approaches

Approach TBD. Consider:
- Privacy-preserving PvP (Payment vs Payment) settlement
- Integration with [approach-private-bonds.md](../approaches/approach-private-bonds.md) DvP patterns for cash leg
- Stablecoin privacy patterns from [private-stablecoins.md](private-stablecoins.md)

## 6) Open Questions

- How does privacy interact with real-time gross settlement requirements?
- What's the role of central bank digital currencies vs private stablecoins?
- How to handle multi-currency atomic swaps with privacy?
