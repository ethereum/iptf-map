## 1) Use Case

Tokenized repurchase agreements where counterparties and transaction amounts must remain confidential. Repo is short-term secured lending - conceptually similar to DeFi flash loans, though TradFi has used this instrument for decades. The intraday lending market processes enormous volumes daily through centralized infrastructure. Privacy prevents counterparty exposure and funding cost arbitrage.

## 2) Additional Business Context

**See confidential context:** [context/use-cases/context-private-repo.md](../../context/use-cases/context-private-repo.md)

## 3) Actors

Banks · Clearing Houses · Prime Brokers · Money Market Funds · Central Banks · Regulators

## 4) Problems

### Problem 1: Counterparty Exposure

Repo counterparty relationships reveal funding dependencies and credit relationships. Public exposure enables competitors to target funding sources or exploit perceived credit weakness.

**Requirements:**

- **Must hide:** Counterparty identities, transaction amounts, collateral details, rates
- **Public OK:** Aggregate market statistics, general market rates
- **Regulator access:** Systemic risk monitoring, counterparty exposure aggregation, collateral sufficiency

**Constraints:**

- Same-day (often intraday) settlement requirements
- Collateral eligibility and haircut calculations
- Netting and novation for clearing
- Central bank facility access requirements

### Problem 2: Funding Cost Arbitrage Prevention

Visible funding costs and patterns enable competitors to undercut pricing or front-run funding needs.

**Requirements:**

- **Must hide:** Specific rates obtained, funding frequency, rollover patterns
- **Public OK:** Reference rates (SOFR, repo indices)
- **Regulator access:** Rate surveillance, market manipulation monitoring

**Constraints:**

- Real-time pricing requirements
- Integration with existing repo infrastructure
- Tri-party vs bilateral repo differences

## 5) Recommended Approaches

Approach TBD. Consider:
- Privacy-preserving collateral verification
- Atomic settlement with privacy (similar to DvP patterns in [approach-private-bonds.md](../approaches/approach-private-bonds.md))
- Integration with existing clearing infrastructure

## 6) Open Questions

- How do intraday settlement requirements interact with privacy mechanisms?
- What's the migration path from centralized repo infrastructure?
- How to handle collateral substitution with position privacy?
