## 1) Use Case

Tokenized equity trading where position sizes, trading activity, and ownership stakes must remain confidential. Traditional exchanges face competitive pressure from crypto-native platforms and seek tokenization to create new products while protecting institutional trading strategies from exposure.

## 2) Additional Business Context

**Confidential context:** Available in private IPTF repo

## 3) Actors

Exchanges · Broker-Dealers · Institutional Investors · Retail Investors · Regulators (SEC, FINRA) · Transfer Agents · Custodians

## 4) Problems

### Problem 1: Position and Trading Privacy

Large institutional positions and trading activity on public ledgers reveal investment strategies and enable front-running.

**Requirements:**

- **Must hide:** Position sizes, trading activity, order flow, accumulation/distribution patterns
- **Public OK:** Security existence, total outstanding shares, corporate actions
- **Regulator access:** Beneficial ownership reporting (13F, 13D/G), insider trading surveillance, market manipulation monitoring

**Constraints:**

- Securities law disclosure thresholds (5%, 10% beneficial ownership)
- Short-selling disclosure requirements
- Real-time trade reporting obligations

### Problem 2: Competitive Positioning for Exchanges

Traditional exchanges tokenizing equity need privacy to differentiate from transparent crypto venues and protect institutional order flow.

**Requirements:**

- **Must hide:** Exchange-specific order flow data, market maker positions
- **Public OK:** Aggregate volume, price discovery (NBBO)
- **Regulator access:** Full audit trail for market surveillance

**Constraints:**

- Best execution obligations
- Market data revenue models
- Interoperability with traditional settlement (T+1)

## 5) Recommended Approaches

Approach TBD. Consider:
- Integration with existing transfer agent infrastructure
- Privacy-preserving beneficial ownership registries
- Hybrid on-chain/off-chain settlement models

## 6) Open Questions

- How do privacy requirements interact with securities law disclosure obligations?
- What's the path from T+1 settlement to instant atomic settlement?
- How to handle corporate actions (dividends, splits) with position privacy?
